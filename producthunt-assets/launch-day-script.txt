üöÄ Launch Day Script
====================

üì± Morning (6 AM PST):
Good morning! Today is the big day - TinySteps launches on ProductHunt!

I'm excited to share this app I created for NICU dads with the world. As someone who experienced the challenges of having a baby in neonatal care, I built TinySteps to support other fathers on this journey.

The app includes milestone tracking, international health services, secure data storage, and dad-focused design - everything I wish I had access to.

Please take a look and give it an upvote if you think it's valuable. Every vote helps get this in front of more dads who need it.
