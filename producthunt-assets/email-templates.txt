Subject: "I just launched my NICU dad support app on ProductHunt!"

Hi [Name],

I'm excited to share that I just launched TinySteps on ProductHunt today!

As you know, I experienced the challenges of having a baby in neonatal care, and I created this app specifically for fathers navigating this journey.

The app includes:
‚Ä¢ Milestone tracking for premature babies
‚Ä¢ International health services (20+ countries)
‚Ä¢ Secure, private data storage
‚Ä¢ Dad-focused design and support

Would you mind taking a look and giving it an upvote if you think it's valuable? Every vote helps get this in front of more dads who need it.
